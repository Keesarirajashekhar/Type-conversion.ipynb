        "2Q.can you explain a real world senario where a using stack would be a more practical chioce than a list for data storge and retrival? A)Sure. Stacks are a type of data structure that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This makes stacks ideal for situations where you need to keep track of the order of items, and only need to access the most recent ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "A real-world scenario where using a stack would be more practical than a list for data storage and retrieval is in a web browser's back button functionality. When you click on a link in a web browser, the URL of the new page is pushed onto the stack. When you click the back button, the URL at the top of the stack is popped off and the browser navigates to that page. This ensures that the most recently visited pages are always easily accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another example is in the undo functionality of a text editor. When you make a change to a document, the previous state of the document is pushed onto the stack. When you click the undo button, the top element of the stack is popped off and the document is restored to its previous state. This allows you to easily revert changes and go back to previous versions of your document.\n",

        "In both of these examples, it is important to keep track of the order of items and only access the most recent ones. Using a stack data structure is ideal for this because it ensures that the last item added is always the first one to be removed.\n",
